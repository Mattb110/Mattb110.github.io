                    <h2 style="color: #EBEBFB;">Description</h2>
                    <p> Welcome to 307 Fiddlers Court, an exceptional 4+1 bedroom executive home with four washrooms
                        situated on a quiet street of west Pickering’s exclusive Rougemount neighbourhood.

                    <p>Set back nicely from the street, this beautiful brick home showcases extensive stone and rock
                        landscaping - including an interlocking driveway, tiered walkway, and steps; as well as a
                        covered
                        front entrance with an oversized entry door and frosted glass sidelights - adding to the home’s
                        curb
                        appeal.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the front door is an incredibly spacious foyer finished with upgraded oversized floor
                        tiles
                        that flow throughout the main hall, the powder room, and the laundry room. The foyer also
                        features
                        wainscoting, decorative crown moldings, and pot lighting - with the latter two design details
                        also
                        seen in the open concept living and dining rooms.</p>

                    <p>The second, third, and fourth bedrooms all feature double closets - and the main 4-pc washroom
                        has a
                        tiled floor and bath area, as well as a vanity with a quartz counter.</p>

                    <p>Through a double door entrance is the very generously sized master suite. Bathed in light
                        through
                        multiple south-facing windows, this exceptional retreat showcases a huge sitting area that
                        overlooks
                        the backyard, and upgraded light fixtures. Along the short hall to its ensuite washroom is a
                        walk-in
                        closet - while the ensuite itself showcases pot lighting and upgraded tiled finishes throughout;
                    </p>

                    <p>Minutes to Dunbarton High and St. Mary Catholic Secondary Schools; as well as a short walk to
                        St.
                        Monica Catholic Elementary and Elizabeth B. Phin Public Schools - this home is also just a short
                        drive to the Pickering Town Centre Mall, the GO Station, and has easy access to Hwy 401 - as
                        well as
                        being close to the shopping, entertainment, and waterfront enjoyment of Pickering’s beautiful
                        Frenchman’s Bay community along Lake Ontario.</p>
